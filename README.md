# vm_translator_project_8

## Description
Fulfills Project 8 of Nand to Tetris 

Translates a provided '.vm' file written in hack VM code into a '.asm' file in the hack assembly language.

    Args:
        input_file (str): input file 'filename.vm'
        # TODO- add ability to handle input directories as well, 
        # in which case all .vm files in the directory are translated into one .asm file

    Returns:
        - generates and saves output file 'filename.asm'

## Background
Project 7 was completed previously, which covered arithmetic logic and memory access. Project 8 completes all remaining parts of the translator, most notably adding branching and function calling logic.

## Objective
Extend the basic VM translator built in project 7 into a full-scale VM translator, designed to handle
multi-file programs written in the VM language. Assume that the source VM code is error-free.

## Contract
Complete the construction of a VM-to-Hack translator, conforming to the VM Specification and
Standard VM Mapping on the Hack Platform. Use your VM translator to translate the supplied VM
test programs, yielding corresponding programs written in the Hack machine language. When
executed on the supplied CPU emulator along with supplied test scripts, the code generated by
your translator should deliver the results mandated by the supplied compare files.
